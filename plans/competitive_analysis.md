# Competitive Analysis

## Key Inspirations

| Game | What We Borrow |
|------|----------------|
| Untitled Goose Game | Simple objectives, physical comedy, honk = instant content |
| Hitman | Sandbox systems, NPC communication, player creativity |
| Octodad | Suspicion meter, "act normal" comedy |

## Viral Moment Formula

**Recipe:** Player agency + NPC reaction + unexpected outcome

**Our tools:**
- 3 visible meters (Stamina, Suspicion, Temper) - players strategize around them
- Expressive NPC reactions (speech bubbles, state indicators)
- Item interactions (steal, drop, recover)
- Honk mechanic for instant chaos

## Design Principles

1. **Readable AI** - Show meters so players can plan
2. **Near-miss tension** - Chase threshold at 70%, not 50%
3. **Recovery windows** - Meters decay, giving second chances
4. **Escalation** - Temper persists longer than suspicion
5. **Clip-worthy moments** - Every catch/escape is shareable
